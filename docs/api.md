# API reference (placeholder)

This file will contain the detailed API reference for QueueBoard: request/response shapes, validation rules, error payloads, and examples.

For now, the single-tenant minimal API surface is summarized in `docs/data-model.md`.

Suggested contents to add:
- Full endpoint list with sample requests/responses
- DTO property definitions and validation attrs
- Concurrency guidance (how `RowVersion` is used)
- Error response shapes and HTTP status mapping
- Notes on paging/filtering conventions

The OpenAPI/Swagger spec generated by the API project should be the canonical source; keep this doc as a human-friendly supplement.
